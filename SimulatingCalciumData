GitHub toolbox to simulate calcium imaging fluorescence time course:
https://github.com/HelmchenLab/CalciumSim

We can use this to generate time courses for several different cells. 
To create a video, we need to also add a spatial component. This can
be defining pixels within simple shapes (circles or ovals) to be a 
single "cell" in which their fluorescence changes according to the
simulated traces. White noise can be added in each frame of the movie
in order to test the robustness of the segmentation algorithms.
