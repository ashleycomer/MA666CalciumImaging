GitHub toolbox to simulate calcium imaging fluorescence time course:
https://github.com/HelmchenLab/CalciumSim

We can use this to generate time courses for several different cells. 
To create a video, we need to also add a spatial component. Cells can
be defined as a group of pixels within a simple shape (circle or oval)
in which the fluorescences of these pixels change over time following
the simulated time courses.
White noise can be added to each frame of the movie
in order to test the robustness of the segmentation algorithms.
We can write a Matlab function to simulate these calcium imaging movies.
